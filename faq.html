					<h2>
						What are the differences between binding and no binding memberships?
					</h2>
					<p>
						As a personal trainer, I can tell you that binding memberships
						require a longer commitment, usually 6-12 months, and often come
						with a lower monthly rate and extra perks, but have cancellation
						fees if you leave early. No-binding memberships, on the other hand,
						allow you to cancel anytime without fees but typically have a higher
						monthly rate. They offer more flexibility but may not include as
						many extras. Binding memberships are best for those with consistent
						routines, while no-binding options suit people with changing
						schedules or those trying out a new gym. Your choice depends on your
						fitness goals, budget, and how certain you are about your long-term
						commitment.

					<h2>Which app is being used for programming and diet?</h2>
					<p class="hidden">
						As your personal trainer, I can confirm that we use the Abel app for
						both programming your workouts and managing your diet plan. Abel is
						an all-in-one fitness platform that allows us to create customized
						workout routines and nutrition plans tailored to your specific
						goals. It helps us track your progress, adjust your program as
						needed, and provides you with easy access to your daily workouts and
						meal recommendations. The app's user-friendly interface makes it
						simple for you to log your exercises, record your food intake, and
						stay connected with me for ongoing support and guidance.

					<h2>
						Is it possible to change membership after I started my first month?
					</h2>
					<p class="hidden">
						Yes, you have the flexibility to adjust your training package after
						the initial month. I understand that your fitness needs and goals
						may evolve over time. You can upgrade, downgrade, or switch your
						training package at the end of any billing cycle. Just let me know a
						few days before your next billing date, and I'll be happy to assist
						you in making the change. This flexibility ensures you're always on
						the plan that best fits your current fitness goals and schedule.
