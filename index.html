				<p>
					Meet Tiago Santos, a passionate personal trainer from the stunning
					island of Madeira, now making waves in the vibrant city of Oslo.
					Tiago's journey into fitness began with a love for sports, especially
					football, which he played throughout his youth and later coached. This
					passion led him to pursue both a Bachelor's and a Master's in Sport
					Sciences, equipping him with the knowledge to help others transform
					their lives through fitness. After relocating to Oslo, Tiago quickly
					built a reputation for his ability to connect with clients on a
					personal level. His extensive experience is filled with inspiring
					success stories, from helping athletes overcome injuries to empowering
					everyday people to reclaim their strength and vitality. What sets
					Tiago apart is his attention to detail, meticulous workout
					programming, and his unique coaching style—empathetic yet firm. His
					clients often find themselves achieving more than they thought
					possible, thanks to his personalized plans and motivating approach.
					Whether you're an athlete or just starting your fitness journey, Tiago
					is here to help you reach your goals. Expect dedication, precision,
