						Born and raised in Portugal, Tiago is a highly experienced trainer
						and sports scientist with over 14 years of experience and more than
						10,000 hours of one-on-one sessions as a personal trainer. He holds
						a Bachelor’s degree in Sports Training and a Master’s in Sports
						Science from ESDRM in Portugal. Football has been Tiago’s first love
						for sports, and the main reason why today he works in this sector.
						Throughout his career, he has had the privilege of working
						extensively in competitive football, which laid a solid foundation
						for his expertise in sports training. During those years, he had the
						opportunity to work in six different countries, allowing him the
						privilege of speaking five languages fluently. Over the past eight
						years, Tiago has expanded his experience to include athletes from
						hockey, bandy, gymnastics, and competitive running, as well as
						everyday individuals seeking to improve their fitness levels and
						health. This diverse background has given him a comprehensive
						understanding of the human body and its biomechanics, making him
						particularly proficient in helping both athletes and fitness
						enthusiasts reach and maintain peak physical performance. Since 2013
						online coaching and programming has become Tiago’s way to be able to
						offer to his most eager costumers a structured view of their own
						training and be able to allow them to reach consistency and better
						results. Also, it gave him the possibility to continue working
						directly with costumers from all over the world and also those that
						no longer live close enough to Oslo where he is located. His
						training philosophy revolves around the principles of human
						movement, integrating elements from gymnastics, weight lifting, and
						high-intensity sports. “I believe that a strong and resilient body
						should be capable of moving efficiently in all vectors of movement
						while also excelling in both strength and cardiovascular fitness.
						This holistic approach ensures that my clients develop not only peak
						performance but also long-term physical health and protection
						against injuries.”
